                            <p>Hello, </p>

                            <p>When I click Add new student, I am given a notification which reads, "You don't have the proper permissions for this!," even though I had such permissions up until yesterday. My supervisor, Johanna Thompson, attempted to fix this several times and has said that my permissions are marked with a "Yes" for adding students. I've closed out of Clockwork and reopened it each time she had tried to make an adjustment, but the error was still occurring.</p>

                            <p>Thanks,<br>
